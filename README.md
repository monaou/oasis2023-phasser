# Project Submission

## Short Overview
Dino Maker is a 2D action game. Players explore a virtual world using blocks and chains. By clearing stages, they earn rewards. Stage creators earn rewards when players fail their challenging levels. Reward amounts and stage configurations are decentralized on-chain, ensuring fairness and equality.

## Vision
Sustainable economic zone through gaming.

## Problem Statement
- **Traditional Games Issues:** No rewards for participants.
- **Recent Web3 Games Issues:** Token inflation with game progression leading to decreased new users.
- **Common Issues in Both:** Centralized system and data management.

## Solution
- Provide rewards to participants with smart contract automation.
- Consistent rewards for participants based on gameplay.
- Decentralized game system with partial on-chain implementation.
- Using community creators and other chain NFTs to expand the economy.

## Technology Used
React.js, Phaser, Sandverse, Smart Contracts, NFT

## Development Methodology
Pages for stage developers were built using React, while the smart contracts were implemented in Solidity. Player pages were crafted with Phaser. Stage and collaboration NFTs are ERC721 and payment ID is ERC20.

## Next Steps for Dino Maker
Transitioning smart contract calls implemented on the frontend to the backend, aiming for secure coding. We plan to use ERC6551 tokens for stage data. We will change the account abstraction wallet and gather more partnerships and NFT creators.
